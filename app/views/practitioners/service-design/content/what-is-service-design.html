<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What is service design?</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">At its simplest, we can think of Service Design as: a user-centred approach to the design 
and delivery of services, which choreographs all of the people, organisations, products, systems, channels (and so on) 
that make up a service, with the objective of meeting the whole needs of a user as simply, quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What makes Service Design different?</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">One of the common challenges we face when explaining Service Design is that many of the individual parts that make up Service Design can be seen as overlapping with the activities of others. 
For example, the activity of mapping how different processes, systems and people interact may be seen as synonymous with the activities
of Business Analysis. Moreover, the activity of understanding user pain points and journeys may be seen as synonymous 
with the activities of User Research or Interaction Design.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Whilst Service Design must work closely with these areas, the job of Service Design is not to replace or replicate these activities. 
Instead, the job of Service Design is to bring together the teams that undertake these other activities (as well as their artefacts and knowledge) 
to understand how they all fit together in the context of a
user's whole need or journey - not within the bounds of an organisational silo.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">In other words, what sets Service Design apart is that it looks to break away and challenge the boundaries, 
assumptions and unintended negative consequences that arise when we design and deliver services from an organisation-centric 
perspective.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Service Design starts from the end-user's perspective, gets a big picture view of their journey and their needs, 
and then works backwards to understand all of the moving parts within an organisation that affect how well these needs/journeys are, 
and could be, provisioned.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">So take a scenario where a user moves from one benefit to another, Service Design would ask whether we can look at the customer journeys from each of these benefits to understand common activities or problems that exist across both. For example, is the user inputting the same information twice? If something changes to their life circumstances, do they have to notify two separate parts of the organisation? Are there two separate teams processing the same information? Are they talking to one another?
Here, Service Design is looking holistically at a user's end-to-end journey to see where there are opportunities for horizontal improvements to user experience and operational efficiencies.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Looking at another example, lets say that User Research has uncovered that a certain part of citizens journey is particularly painful because their are long wait times. Service Design would coordinate with Business Analysis to question whether there's a particular part of the process causing the delay. They may then coordinate between technical, policy and legal teams to understand why that part of the process exists and work to create a better future state.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Here, Service Design is looking front to back, looking at how front-stage activities that users interact with are being affected by back-stage activities that colleagues interact with.</p>
