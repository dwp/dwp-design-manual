<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Giving and receiving feedback</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">GDS publish a series of posters on critique best practice. We follow this guidance in DWP but we’ve added further context and guidance based on our experience.</p>
<p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govdesign/blob/master/Poster_GivingAskingReceivingFeedback.pdf">View the original posters.</a></p>
<p class="govuk-body">We start with the belief that everyone is doing the best they can with what they have to work with.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When giving feedback on work...</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Talk about the work, not the person</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Don’t make it personal.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Adjust your language to say things like “this could be” instead of “you haven’t done this”.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Be specific</h3>
<p class="govuk-body"><p>Don’t make vague or confusing comments.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Explain your reasoning, clarify what you mean and give examples. This will make it easier for the other person to make changes based on your feedback.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Be constructive</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Don’t give personal opinions, such as “I don’t like this”.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">It’s likely you won’t be the user, so it doesn’t matter if you don’t like it.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Ask the person who did the work if they’ve tried alternative approaches instead.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When asking for feedback on work...</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Give some background</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">You’ll get better feedback on your work if you help others understand why you’ve done it.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Explain who your users are, what their needs are and what you’re trying to achieve.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Make sure you include any constraints your working with.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Its a key skill not to over explain the background and use up all of your time.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Say exactly what you want feedback on</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Tell people what you want to find out. This will help them focus their feedback, rather than make general comments about the work.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When receiving feedback on work...</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Don’t talk too much</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">After you’ve explained the background to the work, let people review it in their own time. Try not to over-explain anything. Listen to what they have to say.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Take notes</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to remember what was said and why. If you can, ask someone else to take notes for you. This will help you focus on the conversation.</p>
