<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Design Clinics</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">Design Clinics are sessions you can use to get feedback on your work
    or support on a particular design problem.
    The sessions are attended by a group of 4 experienced interaction
    and service designers.
    Before you attend you’ll be asked what you want to get out of the
    session and to provide some background.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens during a Design Clinic?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The Design Clinic is a 1 hour session where you get to present your work and get feedback.</p> 
<p class="govuk-body">Use this session to get help if you’re finding something particularly
    difficult or need help on what to try next.
    It may be something you’re trying to design, or a related problem
    like trying to bring people onboard with a particular approach.
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Before the session</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">Provide some background on what you’re going to show
    or discuss.
    It’s up to you who comes along from your team, but no
    more than 3 members of your team. You’ll need to
    make sure they have the meeting invite and a link to
    the Mural board.</p>

            <li>5 mins - Agree any actions or next steps</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="govuk-body">Stick to the agenda so there’s plenty of time for feedback
    and sharing ideas - that’s the most valuable part..</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You can bring any artefacts you want to share, but it's not essential.
    The Design Clinic is a great way to get feedback on your work and to learn from other designers.</p>
