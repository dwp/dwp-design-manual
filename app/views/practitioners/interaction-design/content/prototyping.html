<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Prototyping</h1> 

<p class="govuk-body">
    At DWP, we use GitHub to host the code for our prototypes and Heroku to deploy them for the purpose of usability testing.
    As a Designer, there are a few things to keep in mind and standards to follow when it comes to prototyping.

    Prototypes are a tool to test ideas quickly
</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <ul>
      <li>Start small. Sketching is a great tool to work through ideas collaboratively before jumping into any kind of prototype</li>
      <li>Use the right tools that meet the need. If you don’t need an interactive prototype to test with users, don’t spend unnecessary time creating one.</li>
      <li>You don’t need to be a developer to use the GOVUK Prototype Kit</li>
      <li>The GOVUK Prototype kit was designed to be a quick tool to iterate and test prototypes</li>
      <li>Do what you need to do to test your design, don’t overdo it. They only need to be as a high fidelity as required for the testing you are doing.</li>
      <li>If the prototype works, don’t worry about having beautiful code.</li>
      <li>There are no Dev standards for writing prototype code</li>
      <li>There is lots of guidance for using the GOVUK Prototype Kit</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Expectations for designers creating prototypes</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>You have design documentation available for people to digest what design decisions have been made</li>
    <li>Your prototype is listed on Confluence with all the relevant information for people to see</li>
    <li>Your prototype does not have any data or sensitive information in it that is not suitable for public consumption</li>
    <li>You will use the GOVUK and DWP Design Systems as a starting point for testing designs. If the patterns, styles and components do not meet the needs of your users, you can use design systems from other government departments or propose a new one. If you propose a new pattern, style or component, it must be shared and reviewed via the appropriate channels</li>
    <li>You will regularly share your work</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
