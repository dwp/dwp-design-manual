    The definition of done does not tell you how to do these things. There are different methods and tools you can use. 
    Our measures of success guidance includes examples of how you might meet each point.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who decides what needs to be done</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">As the design professionals, you decide what needs to be done to tick each item off the checklist. You may also decide that a particular thing isn’t justified for the design you’re working on.</p>


<p class="govuk-body">For example, you may decide you don’t need a fact check on a cosmetic design change, or that you don’t need to conduct research when fixing a typo.
</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you can’t complete the checklist</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">It may be that you can’t complete the checklist but need to produce a piece of work anyway. Common examples include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>delivery timelines mean you need to create and release something quickly</li>
    <li>you do not have access to sufficient data or research</li>
    <li>your team does not have access to accessibility testing tools</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">The product owner decides what is acceptable to be released. However, if you can’t complete the checklist it might mean that further work is needed to fully validate the design. You should record any design debt in your documentation.</p>
