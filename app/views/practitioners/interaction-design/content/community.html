  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">DWP wide Interaction Design monthly community meeting (Teams)</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    The Interaction Design monthly community meeting is a chance to share work, get feedback and learn from each other. We use this time to:
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>stay up to date with activity relevant to our profession and the User Centred Design practice</li>
        <li>see examples of work from other parts of the department</li>
        <li>discuss challenges with like-minded colleagues</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
    Interaction design community meetings
    </h2>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">We’re a dispersed team, so we create a strong community by having regular meet-ups virtually and in person across the country.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">As part of your induction you will be invited to the community meetings relevant to you.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">All designers are expected to make a positive contribution to community meetings by:</p>
    
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>taking part</li>
    <li>sharing their work</li>
    <li>giving feedback on others’ work</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">There are also plenty of other events related to interaction design, organised by the government and others.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">Ask other interaction designers in your regional team what’s going on.</p>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
    Interaction design community days
    
    <p class="govuk-body">All our interaction designers meet up together every 3 months.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">Less frequently, we hold meet-ups where people with a wider affiliation to interaction design come along, too.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">At the moment these events are being hosted online, but we hope to do them face to face again soon.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">At both of these types of get-togethers, people:</p>
    
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>give presentations on work they’ve been doing</li>
    <li>listen to guest speakers</li>
    <li>try to address interaction design issues collectively </li>
    </ul>
    
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">Interaction design community on Slack</h4>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Slack is used in the design community to chat, collaborate and share.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">It may already be installed on your Mac or it’s available in the ‘Collaboration’ section in the Self Service application.

<p class="govuk-body">You may also want to download Slack to your personal mobile device (but there’s no obligation to).

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
Slack etiquette
</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Slack is not an alternative to email - not all members of staff across DWP have access to Slack. You should think about your audience when deciding which communication tool to use.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If you want to discuss or share something with the design community Slack is usually the first choice.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">All digital communications that public servants use are subject to Freedom of information regulation. All messages, public, private, group and direct can be requested and released. Be mindful of what you say and share.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
Workspaces
</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">You will be invited to two workspaces in Slack:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list">
<li>DWP - dwpdigital.slack</li>
<li>UK government - ukgovernmentdigital.slack</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
Channels
</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Each workspace is divided into channels set up around different themes.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The main channel you will use is #interaction-design in the DWP workspace. We’ll invite you and introduce you to the community.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Use this channel to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>ask interaction design questions</li>
<li>share work for feedback</li>
<li>help others with their interaction design problems</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">This means all interaction designers can see and take part in conversations about each others work.

<p class="govuk-body">The senior designer in your area will invite you to the relevant channels you need for the service you’re working on.
