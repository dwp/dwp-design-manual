<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Documenting design decisions</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">As interaction designers it is important that we document design decisions around our work.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">In terms of the essential documentation, as a community we agreed that the following would be the best starting point:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Visualised User Journey Flows</li>
    <li>Versioned prototype with links to UR, WIP and hypotheses</li>
    <li>Summary (headlines) of whatâ€™s changed and why with design</li>
    <li>Project stage</li>
    <li>Links to decision logs / UR hypotheses</li>
</ul>
