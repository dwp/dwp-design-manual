<p class="govuk-body"> User research is more than just usability testing prototypes with users. User research helps us understand users and their needs, and ensure we are creating
     services that meet those needs.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If we design and build services without understanding users and their needs, we will not know if the problems we are trying to solve are the right ones, 
    if the service will actually enable users to do what they need to do, or meet the business need in solving those problems</p>
