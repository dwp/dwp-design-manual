        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">These principles are not only useful for content designers to think about, but also colleagues working in all of the areas that touch content design - service teams, policy, communications and operations.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you’re new to content design as a profession, here are some excellent articles which help explain what we do.</p>

          Service development phases
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Services go through discovery, alpha, private beta and public beta phases before they go live.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Depending upon their size, services may have to be assessed before they can go on to the next phase.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">As part of their assessment, services have to show how they’ve made content decisions based on user research and analytics.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Content designers can – and usually should – be involved in service development at each of these stages.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">These are some of the things a Content Designer can be doing at each agile project phase.</p>

        Who we work with
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        When building services, we work in agile delivery teams. Agile is about building things quickly, testing them and changing them based on continual feedback.
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Each agile team should be made up of or have access to a:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>product owner</li>
      <li>user researcher</li>
      <li>interaction designer</li>
      <li>content designer</li>
      <li>front-end developer</li>
      <li>back-end developer</li>
      <li>technical architect</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">These roles are collaborative; you don’t design content alone.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Agile teams are to a large extent self-organising and work in different ways. You’ll find out more when you join your own team.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">This way of working is still new to the department. An important part of your role is to encourage teams to work in this way.</p>
