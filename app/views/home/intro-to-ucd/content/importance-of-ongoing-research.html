<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">The importance of ongoing user research</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">User research is critical in the UCD process. It forms the foundation of any successful design by ensuring decisions are based on evidence rather than assumptions or opinions.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">This needs to be an ongoing process that occurs throughout a project, not just at the beginning. Needs can change over time, as can the way users interact with a service. Therefore, research should be integrated into every stage of development to iteratively test and refine services based on real user feedback.</p>
