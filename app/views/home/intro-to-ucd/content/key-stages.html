<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Key stages of the UCD process</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The UCD process typically involves several key stages:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><strong>Defining the Context</strong> - identifying different citizen segments and conducting thorough user research such as surveys, interviews, and usability testing. This stage also ensures alignment with overall policy objectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Defining User Needs and Requirements</strong> - translating user insights into actionable requirements, prioritising features based on their impact, and setting clear success metrics for the design.</li>
  <li><strong>Co-creating and Designing Solutions</strong> - engaging citizens in design workshops and prototyping to gather feedback and refine concepts, balancing user needs with technical constraints.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementing and Refining</strong> - launching and monitoring the service, gathering feedback via analytics, and iteratively improving it based on user data.</li>
</ul>
