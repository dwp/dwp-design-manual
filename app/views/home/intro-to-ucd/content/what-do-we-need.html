<h4 class="govuk-heading-l">What do we need from colleagues?</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">To work effectively, we need:
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><strong>Support from leadership.</strong> User-centred design isn’t optional—it needs buy-in at all levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Time to do design properly.</strong> Rushing to deliver something ‘fast’ often leads to failure and rework.</li>
  <li><strong>Access to users. </strong> We can’t design for people if we can’t talk to them.</li>
  <li><strong>Willingness to act on research insights. </strong> If user research tells us something isn’t working, we need to change it.</li>
</ul>
