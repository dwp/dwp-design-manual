<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Common barriers and solutions</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Several barriers can affect UCD implementation in public sector organisations:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>lack of UCD skills among existing staff - address through training and upskilling</li>
  <li>traditional governance structures that discourage agile approaches - update to enforce UCD principles</li>
  <li>siloed teams creating disjointed user experiences - integrate into single team structures</li>
</ul>
