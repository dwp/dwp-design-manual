<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Human-centric design vs User-centred design</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">While both approaches focus on understanding the end-user, human-centric design acknowledges wider complexities of the human experience. It considers those who benefit from a service but may not be direct users (for example, a child benefiting from a service designed for a parent).</p>
