<p class="govuk-body">Several tools and methods are used in the UCD process to ensure that services are designed effectively:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><strong>Empathy walls</strong> - visual tools to collect and analyse user research findings, displaying insights about users' behaviours, needs, pain points, and opportunities for improvement</li>
  <li><strong>Journey maps</strong> - map out the user's relationship with a service over time, highlighting all touch points and emotional states</li>
  <li><strong>Card sorting</strong> - used to understand how users think about and categorise information</li>
  <li><strong>Service maps</strong> - visual representations of the systems, technologies, data, and agencies involved in a service</li>
  <li><strong>User stories</strong> - define user requirements in concise statements</li>
  <li><strong>Prototyping and Usability testing</strong> - creating mock ups of designs and testing them with real users</li>
</ul>
