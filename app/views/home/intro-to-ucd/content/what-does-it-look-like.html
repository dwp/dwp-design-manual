<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">What does working in a user-centred way look like?</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><strong>User research is continuous, not a one-off activity.</strong> We don’t just ‘tick the research box’ and move on.</li>
  <li><strong>Design decisions are based on evidence, not opinions.</strong> We test and iterate instead of relying on gut feelings.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy and service design must align.</strong> A great policy idea can fail if it doesn’t work in real life for users.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaboration is key.</strong> UCD professionals should work with product managers, developers, and policy teams from the start—not be brought in at the end.</li>
</ul>
