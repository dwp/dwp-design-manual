<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What does user-centred design actually do?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">UCD is not just “making things look nice.” It’s about understanding users, their needs, and designing services that work for them. A good UCD team will:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><strong>Do discovery properly </strong> - Uncovering what users really need, beyond assumptions.</li>
  <li><strong>Prototype early, fail fast</strong> - Testing ideas quickly to avoid costly mistakes.</li>
  <li><strong>Design inclusively  </strong> - Ensuring no one is excluded, especially those with access needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Advocate for simplicity</strong> - Making complex processes easy to use.</li>
</ul>
