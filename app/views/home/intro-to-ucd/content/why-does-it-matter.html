<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Why does user-centred design matter in government?</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li><strong>It’s a legal and ethical requirement. </strong> - The Public Sector Equality Duty and accessibility laws mean we must design services that work for everyone. It’s not just ‘good practice’—it’s the law.</li>
<li><strong>It saves time and money.</strong> - Fixing poor design decisions late in delivery (or post-launch) is far more expensive than getting it right early.</li>
<li><strong>It reduces risk. </strong> - Designing with users from the start helps prevent policy or service failure down the line.</li>
<li><strong>It improves outcomes for users and government.</strong> - Services that work well for users mean fewer failed transactions, less demand on support teams, and better policy outcomes.</li>
</ul>
