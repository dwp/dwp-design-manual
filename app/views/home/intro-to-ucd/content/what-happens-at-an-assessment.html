    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">What to cover on the day</h1>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Spend the first 30 minutes of the assessment talking about and demonstrating what you’ve built. During that time, you’ll need to:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>give an overview of your service</li>
        <li>walk the panel through the user journey</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Give an overview of your service</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        In any assessment, it’s useful to start by briefly setting the scene. This usually means talking about the things you learnt during your discovery and alpha, including:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>why you’re solving the problem you’re solving</li>
        <li>who your users are and what they’re trying to do</li>
        <li>the work you’ve done to understand the user’s wider journey, if there is one</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        It’s also useful to explain any changes you made based on the feedback the service got at its previous assessment, if it had one. You probably shouldn’t spend more than 10 minutes covering these issues.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Walk the panel through the user journey</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Once you’ve explained what your service is and why you’re building it, spend around 20 minutes walking the panel through what you’ve built.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        You might not have time to show every screen, but you should make sure to show any particularly important interactions.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        And don’t just focus on the happy path. Also show what happens to users who are not eligible, or who cannot provide a piece of evidence at the right time.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Remember to talk about the whole user journey, including offline channels. This means explaining the processes that support staff need to follow to deliver the service, as well as the skills and capabilities they need to have.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        At the alpha stage, you don’t necessarily need to prototype the entire user journey - just enough to test your riskiest assumptions. It might be worth bringing along a set of user needs or a rough journey map to your assessment too.

        This post on the <a href="https://services.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/12/service-demos-how-to-tell-the-story-of-your-service/" class="govuk-link">services in government blog</a> gives advice about how to tell the story of your service.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Answer questions from the panel</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Once you’ve demonstrated your service, the panel will spend the remaining time asking questions about the decisions you’ve made and how you’ve built your service.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        There’s no specific set of questions that a panel will ask during an assessment. It’ll differ depending on the service you’ve built and which development phase you’re in.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        It’s a good idea to make sure you and your team are familiar with:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the Service Standard</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery#phase-of-an-agile-project" class="govuk-link">the agile phases</a> and the requirements for the development phase you’re working in</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        There’s also guidance on how <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-to-apply-the-service-standard" class="govuk-link">assessors will apply the Service Standard</a>.
