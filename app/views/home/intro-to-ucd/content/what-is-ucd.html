<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">What is User Centred Design?</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">User-Centred Design (UCD) is a design methodology that places the 
  needs and experiences of the people who will use a service at the heart of the design process.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Rather than focusing on internal processes or technological constraints, UCD starts by understanding the users' needs, motivations, and pain points. 
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">In the public sector, this is especially crucial because services need to be accessible, intuitive, and effective for all citizens, who often have diverse needs and levels of technical proficiency. 
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">By prioritising the user, UCD aims to improve service delivery, build trust and transparency, increase service adoption 
        and ultimately create public services that are genuinely helpful and user-friendly.</p>
