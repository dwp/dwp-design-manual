<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How UCD improves public service delivery</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">UCD plays a crucial role in improving public service delivery by focusing on the end user. By emphasising the citizen's needs, services can be made more accessible and intuitive, streamlining processes and reducing administrative burdens.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">UCD encourages the creation of interfaces that are user-friendly, clear communication, and less complicated procedures.
