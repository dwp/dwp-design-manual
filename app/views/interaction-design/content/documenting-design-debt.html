<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Documenting design debt</h1>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">What design debt is</h2>


<p class="govuk-body">Design debt is when you have something that you know you need to revisit and do more work.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Some examples of design debt include when:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>your design is a temporary fix to mitigate a current technical limitation</li>
    <li>you’ve had to release something before it’s ‘done’ and need to iterate retrospectively</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Make it transparent</h2>


<p class="govuk-body">Your design debt documentation should be an open artefact.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">At minimum, your documentation should be accessible by everyone in your team and sharable with stakeholders.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Ideally, your design debt log should be accessible by everyone in DWP - but this may not be achievable.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Where to put it</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">To make your design debt as transparent as possible you should keep your documentation in a findable place.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">A good choice would be to keep it in the same place as the rest of your team’s documentation, for example a team Confluence space, Mural board or SharePoint site.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you keep your design debt documentation somewhere else you should provide clear links to it from your team space.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Talk about it</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Design debt documentation is not a substitute for conversations with your team. If releasing a design will cause debt, you must raise this with the right people and explain the risks. In particular, your Product Owner should be informed and confirm that they want to proceed anyway.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">What you should include</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Your design debt documentation should include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the date the debt was created, or discovered</li>
    <li>a description of what the debt is</li>
    <li>an explanation of why it went live with debt</li>
    <li>a brief outline of the possible risks caused by the debt</li>
    <li>details of what needs to be done to remove the debt</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">This is the minimum that you must include, but you can include more if you think it’s needed.</p>
Linking to other documentation

<p class="govuk-body">Many teams document in other artefacts, such as Jira tickets and research reports. Your design debt documentation should give enough of a summary to understand the problem and proposed solution at a high level, but you can link out to other sources for additional detail and evidence.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">How to use design debt documentation</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Keep a record</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Use the documentation to keep a record of debt, identified risks and actions needed to resolve.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Advocate for action</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">You should advocate for the inclusion of design debt into your team’s product backlog, risk log, prioritisation discussions and, ultimately, to be picked up as part of the workflow.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Keeping a record does not replace the need to advocate for action.</p>
