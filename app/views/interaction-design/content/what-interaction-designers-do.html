    Our mission
  </h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    To design the best way to let users interact with servicesn and systems. In terms of both overall flow and at the level of individual design elements.

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
    The problem we're here to solve
  </h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    DWP creates services and systems for internal and external users. For both groups, our services and systems can be difficult to find, understand and use. This is because they’re not always designed specifically to meet their needs.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
This has a negative impact on people’s wellbeing and society as a whole. And it costs DWP and the wider economy money.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">There’s an opportunity to address this by designing services and systems that enables:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>people to easily complete a task or find information for themselves wherever appropriate</li>
<li>DWP’s staff to provide effective support to people who need it</li>
</ul>
</p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
    What we do
  </h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Some of the products and services we design are used by the public, some are used by staff from DWP and other Government departments.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">We build these products and services based on people’s needs.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">We use data and feedback to create journeys and interactions that makes people’s dealings with our part of the government as simple, quick and easy as possible.</p>



    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Why we do it
    </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We support some of the most vulnerable people in society.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">We design services and systems to be as accessible as possible to everyone.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">We have a related aim of promoting digital use of government services to save time and money for users and for us.</p>
