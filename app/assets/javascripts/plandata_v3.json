We also need to get the latest address if the citizen has provided DWP with a new address, outside the NS-JSA/MYC context, e.g. UC.\r\n\r\nThus, we need for a specific Citizen (using GUID first provided by Matching application) who could be the claimant or appointee:\r\n•Get the latest current address;\r\n•Get date address was updated;\r\n•Get address type: residential, temporary address e.g. rehabilitation centre;\r\n•Provide new current address;\r\n•Provide address type: residential, temporary address e.g. rehabilitation centre.\r\n\r\nNote: Phone number, correspondence address and email are held by Notification service.

Such markers will drive the correct procedure to handle a claimant and their claim, e.g. the usage of a dedicated meeting room with the close presence of a security guard. \r\n\r\nThus, we need:\r\n•Get the list of the markers so they can be displayed to the agents and they can apply the right procedures.\r\n\r\nDWP Matching\r\n\r\nARA documentation on Matching\r\n\r\nSince we ask for the NINO in the application form, we do not really need the Matching service. However, we need to use this service to get the internal GUID used by DWP to identify claimants uniquely. The GUID is necessary to use DWP Citizen Relationships and DWP Citizen Event History enterprise applications.\r\n\r\nSince we identify a citizen by their NINO (for the moment), we need:\r\n•Lookup a citizen via a NINO;\r\n•Get their GUID.\r\n\r\nNote: We should not use NINO in the future. We should use the Matching service to match a claimant with an internal citizen and get their DWP's GUID. When NS-JSA apply changes and do not request the NINO, then we should use the Matching service to identify the citizen using their: full name, date of birth, current/previous addresses.\r\n\r\nStatus: Live. Used by Carers Pathfinder.

When ask somebody wants a manual step to be done,  and can create affinity workcoach to citizen. so fraud can ask something to be verified. There is a Task UI but can build and use APIs.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we do not envisage a citizen self-service option for MYC. Self-service has been mentioned and will probably be on a roadmap, but it will probably not be in the MVP. However, agents may requests claimants to perform some tasks that will be checked at the next interview. Agents themselves will probably have tasks to complete related to a claim. Thus, it is likely that we shall need to integrate to the DWP Tasks enterprise application.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we may need:\r\n•Provide, retrieve, mark as completed tasks for a citizen or an agent:•GUID of the citizen or ID of agent;\r\n•Claim it is related to;\r\n•Date due or period; \r\n•To be done by the citizen or appointee or agent;\r\n•Status: unaasigned, assigned, worked on, completed, close;\r\n•Can cable and update a task.\r\n•Be able to send reminder by email or SMS or MYC to receive notifications near the due date. > Citizen receive SMS a task but then need portal\r\n\r\n\r\nDWP Notifications\r\n\r\nARA documentation on Notifications\r\n\r\nNS-JSA already sends an email (GDS Notify) to the claimant to confirm the submission of the claim and reminding them of the documents they will need to provide to support the claim. MYC will also need to send notifications, for instance to remind the claimant/appointee of an interview. \r\n\r\nThus, we need:\r\n•Send an email (and maybe SMS) to citizen & appointee confirming next interview appointment;\r\n•Send a SMS  (and maybe an email) to remind the citizen & appointee of a coming interview;\r\n•Send a SMS or email to citizen or appointee about a task they need to complete;\r\n•Send email and/or letter when reached end of NS-JSA claim with information about claiming Class 1 stamp;\r\n•The service needs to easily change the templates of the standard messages (emails, SMS or letter);•The template should offer the possibility to have conditional fields so we can have tailored messages sent, e.g. with the relevant list of pieces of evidence that a claimant needs to bring to support their claim;\r\n\r\n•Work coaches would like to be able to send \"non-standard\"  ad-hoc messages. → Clerical notification (there is a manual step behind the scenes)\r\n\r\nDWP Evidence\r\n\r\nARA documentation on Evidence\r\n\r\nFor some NS-JSA specific NS-JSA claims, the citizen is asked to bring evidences, e.g. Pension papers. The system should help the work coach handle the evidences brought. Also DWP Agents (work coach, decision makers...) should be able to check whether evidences have been provided and review them to check their validity.\r\n\r\nThus, we need, for a specific claimant (GUID):\r\n•See list and content of evidences already provided (work coach, processing agents, decision maker, fraud and error agent, disputes/appeals agents)\r\n•Add new evidence (mainly work coach and processing agents)\r\n•Remove old or invalid evidence?\r\n\r\nDWP Reference Data\r\n\r\nARA Documentation on Reference Data\r\n\r\nG4S and work coaches need to know what is the nearest Jobcentre to a citizen address to book an interview. They also need to make sure the Jobcentre has the facilities to support the interviews when a claimant has special needs. This information is needed when a claim is submitted (update of NS-JSA) or when a claimant moves to a new address while is claiming NS-JSA. Further information on the jobcentre is also needed when booking an interview, e.g. rooms.\r\n\r\nThus, we need:\r\n•\"Closest\" Jobcentre to a postcode;\r\n•List of facilities of the jobcentre: accessibility, audio loops, etc;\r\n•Public phone number to contact jobcentre;\r\n•List of rooms available to book and appointment for some specific interviews, e.g. when claimant has a PV marker against them. ERP SOP has that info at the moment.\r\n\r\nMultiple projects? e.g. Working Age would have JobCentre... DNA defines who would own.\r\n\r\nDWP Internal Identity\r\n\r\nARA documentation on Internal Identity\r\n\r\nNecessary to identity Agents. Note: NS-JSA uses ADFS. ADFS may become an identity provider for Internal Identity.\r\n\r\nFor time being ADFS.\r\n\r\nWe need:\r\n•A transparent way to get the identity of the Agents (SSO);\r\n•Receive information on the Agent compatible with the requirements of Audit (ATAS2 or replacement of ATAS2);\r\n•Receive the name of the Agent to display on screen if necessary;\r\n•Have a notion of role attached to the user to control access to the functions of MYC. Note: NS-JSA receives the roles from ADFS.\r\n\r\nWill the roles be handled by Internal Identity? \r\n\r\nDWP People\r\n\r\nARA documentation on People\r\n\r\nWe probably need to know whether an agent is going to be on Leave and know their skills in order to manage the appointments. Need to check user needs for MYC.\r\n\r\nThus, we need for a specific agent:\r\n•Search an agent by skill and office; (Note: reference data does not provide a list of agent per office. It does not go down to individual level).\r\n•Get list of skills of an agent;\r\n•Get Leave dates of an agent;\r\n•Get Sickness dates of an agent.\r\n\r\nNote: Product being evaluated.\r\n\r\nDWP Appointments\r\n\r\nARA documentation on Appointments\r\n\r\nG4S agents and work coaches need to book/amend/cancel appointments for a claimant/appointee.\r\n\r\nThus, we need:\r\n•From call-centre view:•Search slots available over a fortnight within a jobcentre•For a specific type of interview (Initial Work Search Interview/Committment) → agents with specific skillset. But the G4S agent does not need to get the name of a work coach. They just need to know that there is a slot available.\r\n•For claimant with specific needs: Potential Violent, Accessibility, Audio loops, translation\r\n\r\n•Make a booking for a Citizen (DWP GUID) from one of the relevant slots found. Note: It could also involve an appointee.\r\n\r\n•Work coach view:•Retrieve their list of appointments for a specific day, the service and type (NS-JSA, NS-ESA, UC)  and their status (confirmed, due, done, cancelled?...)\r\n•Make an appointment for a Citizen or group of citizens  for any type of interview.•For a specific type of interview, e.g. WFR or IWSI•Using pre-defined duration or ad-hoc duration\r\n•Warning if an interview requires skill that the agent does not have?\r\n\r\n•For ad-hoc need•Using ad-hoc duration\r\n\r\n•Book a room with specific equipment depending on the Citizen needs: Potential Violent, Accessibility, Audio loops, translation.\r\n•Be able to mark an appointment as a \"recurrent\", e.g. every 2 weeks for six months? To check. Raise the issue of slots not being available in the future.\r\n\r\n•Transfer an appointment to another work coach•Need to see other work coaches availability\r\n\r\n•Cancel an appointment, e.g. if citizen has found a new job\r\n•Change date / time of a booking → without having to go through the full cancellation and (re)creation processes.\r\n•Indicate a No Show for an appointment (usually after the Work coach tried to contact the claimant and could not arrange a different date) and free the slot\r\n\r\n•Work coach manager / diary manager:•Define new types of bookings and associated constraints: skills, rooms, equipment → This could be more service-specific and not handle by the Appointments Enterprise Application Itself.\r\n•Be notified if work coach going on leave or sick has appointments\r\n•Transfer booking to another work coach•Need to see other work coaches availability\r\n\r\n•Be notified of overbooking.\r\n\r\n•Send a notification of the action, creation/amendment/cancellation, via SMS or/and Email to the Citizen\r\n•Citizen to receive a reminder x days before the appointment. \r\n•Note: Duration of booking should include preparation time and post-interview time, but invitation sent to citizen should not include these preparation and post-interview times.\r\n•Be able to see one's appointment in Outlook.\r\n\r\nDWP Support Offers\r\n\r\nARA documentation on Support Offers\r\n\r\nDuring the interviews, the work coaches support the claimants in their search of work. This support may involve referrals to training, work experience, work placement... \r\n\r\nThus, we need:\r\n•For the Work coach to find training or work experience... matching the claimant's needs: skills, location, duration.\r\n•Be able to get information on the status of the referral: accepted, ongoing, completed.\r\n•Act on the referral depending on the change of circumstances of the Claimant, e.g. found work.\r\n•We need to provide employment history, skills we gather to Support Offers, probably using Support Offers screens.\r\n\r\nNote: If we definitively move to self-service, then this could be offer to the claimant.\r\n\r\nDWP Case Management\r\n\r\nARA Documentation on Case Management\r\n\r\nMYC will be probably used when working on Disputes, Appeals and Fraud. Information will need to be collected to handle each case. Thus, an integration to the Case Management enterprise application will probably be needed.\r\n\r\nDWP External Identity\r\n\r\nARA documentation on External Identity\r\n\r\nTo check citizen (claimant or appointee) identity. Needed if we go down the self-service route.\r\n\r\nJames Randall\r\n\r\nDWP Trust\r\n\r\nARA Documentation on Trust\r\n\r\nThis is a back-end service to rate the trust of a user and their actions. For MYC, will be useful to rate face-to-face or over the phone transactions with a claimant.\r\n\r\nJames Randall.\r\n\r\nWe need:\r\n•Provide to trust GUID of citizen, actions performed;\r\n•Get a trust score scan notify Agent of possible issue/fraud? to investigate.\r\n•Notify Fraud of potential fraud.\r\n\r\nDWP Feedback\r\n\r\nARA documentation on Feedback\r\n\r\nApply NS-JSA is collection the Citizen and Agents feedback. MYC will collect Agents' feedback. There is not Citizen self-service planned for the moment. \r\n\r\nWe need:\r\n•Store feedback anonymously;\r\n•Have an overall rating score (easier to analyse, see trends...);\r\n•Be able to define questions (open text questions for instance) and store and retrieve the responses for further analysis;\r\n•Be able to retrieve feedback received over a period of time;\r\n•Receive notification of a bad review/complaint.\r\n\r\nCurrently a SaaS product. Currently not APIs and Events. Works ongoing.\r\n\r\nDWP Analytics\r\n\r\nARA documentation on Analytics\r\n\r\n Do we need to generate specific events for it?\r\n\r\nOutput from analytics may give information on how to improve the service. Also, it could be necessary for Fraud and security teams.\r\n\r\nDWP Management Information\r\n\r\nARA documentation on Management Information\r\n\r\nThis enterprise application collects all events and generates reports for stakeholders. \r\n\r\nDo we need to do generate specific events for it?\r\n\r\nDoes it replace LMSMIS and BIS? yes\r\n\r\nAddress Verification\r\n\r\nAddress LookUp Sevice (ALUS)\r\n\r\nNo documentation in ARA\r\n\r\nAccessible through the API Gateway of Integration Team managed by Jacqui Leggetter.\r\n\r\nStatus: Used by Child Maintenance Service since April. https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/blog/integration-we-delivered-5\r\n\r\nA claimant can indicate to a work coach, during an interview, that there is a mistake in their address or that they have moved. To minimise the number of errors, the new address should be verified when entered by the work coach. The entry of the address could also be sped up thanks to a post-code and house number lookup option.\r\n\r\nBank Wizard\r\n\r\nNo documentation in ARA\r\n\r\nAccessible through the API Gateway of Integration Team managed by Jacqui Leggetter.\r\n\r\nStatus: Went live for Confirm Your Identity in July. https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/blog/integration-we-delivered-6\r\n\r\nIf a claimant does not provide the bank details during the application to the NS-JSA or if, during an interview, the claimant indicates a change of bank details, a work coach should capture the new bank details.
