The DWP User Centred Design Manual

This is a community owned artefact with two goals:

- To inform non-ucd colleagues about what ucd is, the importance of ucd in DWP, how we work and standards, guidance and principles.
- To provide UCD practitioners with guidance on expectations, tools, ways of working and best practices in DWP.

Contributions are encouraged, colleagues can create branches, make changes and raise a pull request to continue developing the manual to me the needs of users. For colleagues not comfortable contributing code directly, or who want to provide feedback, they can reach out on teams, slack or email to the Interaction design practice leads.
